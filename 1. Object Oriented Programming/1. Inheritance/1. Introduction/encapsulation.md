# Encapsulation

Encapsulation can define as the process of connecting and binding together the data and objects and keeps them safe from outside interference and misuse.
This can be implemented or achieved by making the fields of the class Private and providing access to those fields using public methods.

## Types of Access Modifiers

There are few Access Modifiers which help in encapsulation
- Private
- No Modifier
- Protected
- Public


Modifier 		Class  	 Package   Sub Class	Other Classes
Private			Yes			No			No			No
No Modifier		Yes			yes			No			No
Protected		Yes			Yes			Yes			No
Public 			Yes			Yes			Yes			Yes

# Advantages on Encapsulation

- The encapsulated code is more flexible and easy to change with new requirements.
- It prevents the other classes to access the private fields.
- Encapsulation allows modifying implemented code without breaking other code that has implemented the code.
- It keeps the data and codes safe from external inheritance. Thus, Encapsulation helps to achieve security.
